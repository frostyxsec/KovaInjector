🎯 **KovaInjector** is a powerful shell-based tool designed to decompile Android APKs, detect and patch root/security detection strings and methods, and rebuild the APK — making it easier to test or analyze protected Android applications.

---

## 🔥 Features

- ✅ Patches common root and VPN detection strings in Smali code
- 🔍 Detects and disables security check methods (like `isDeviceRooted`, `isVPNConnected`, `isEmulatorDevice`, etc.)
- 🧩 Attempts multiple decompilation strategies for stubborn APKs
- 🔧 Rebuilds APK with compatibility fallbacks
- 🔐 Automatically signs the output APK for easy installation
- 🖥️ Terminal UI with stylish color-coded outputs

---

## 📦 Requirements

Make sure these tools are installed and available in your system's PATH:

- `apktool`
- `grep`
- `sed`
- `zipalign`
- `apksigner`
- (Optional) `aapt` / `aapt2`

You can install them via:

```bash
apt install apktool
snap install apktool
brew install apktool
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
./kova.sh -apk <input.apk> -o <output.apk>
```

### 📘 Example:

```bash
./kova.sh -apk target.apk -o patched_target.apk
```

### ℹ️ Important Note:

> ⚠️ This tool won't work on APKs with **modification protection** or **signature verification**. You must remove such protections manually beforehand.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Dependency Check**  
   Verifies your system has all required tools before proceeding.

2. **APK Decompilation**  
   Attempts to decompile the APK. If standard decompilation fails, it uses fallbacks like `--no-res` and `--only-main-classes`.

3. **String & Method Patching**  
   Replaces root/VPN/emulator detection strings and patches methods to return safe values (`false`, `null`, etc.).

4. **APK Rebuild & Sign**  
   Rebuilds the patched APK and signs it using your debug keystore (auto-generated if not found).

5. **Result**  
   A patched APK that bypasses common Android security checks!
