üéØ **KovaInjector** is a powerful shell-based tool designed to decompile Android APKs, detect and patch root/security detection strings and methods, and rebuild the APK ‚Äî making it easier to test or analyze protected Android applications.

---

## üî• Features

- ‚úÖ Patches common root and VPN detection strings in Smali code
- üîç Detects and disables security check methods (like `isDeviceRooted`, `isVPNConnected`, `isEmulatorDevice`, etc.)
- üß© Attempts multiple decompilation strategies for stubborn APKs
- üîß Rebuilds APK with compatibility fallbacks
- üîê Automatically signs the output APK for easy installation
- üñ•Ô∏è Terminal UI with stylish color-coded outputs

---

## üì¶ Requirements

Make sure these tools are installed and available in your system's PATH:

- `apktool`
- `grep`
- `sed`
- `zipalign`
- `apksigner`
- (Optional) `aapt` / `aapt2`

You can install them via:

```bash
apt install apktool
snap install apktool
brew install apktool
```

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Important Note:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This tool won't work on APKs with **modification protection** or **signature verification**. You must remove such protections manually beforehand.

---

## üß† How It Works

1. **Dependency Check**  
   Verifies your system has all required tools before proceeding.

2. **APK Decompilation**  
   Attempts to decompile the APK. If standard decompilation fails, it uses fallbacks like `--no-res` and `--only-main-classes`.

3. **String & Method Patching**  
   Replaces root/VPN/emulator detection strings and patches methods to return safe values (`false`, `null`, etc.).

4. **APK Rebuild & Sign**  
   Rebuilds the patched APK and signs it using your debug keystore (auto-generated if not found).

5. **Result**  
   A patched APK that bypasses common Android security checks!
